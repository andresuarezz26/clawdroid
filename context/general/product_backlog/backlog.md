## Sprint 1 Feb 11 - 2026 
- When the response is too long in telegram the agent doesn't reply so user never recieves a message
- Currently when user closes the app the telegram flag is lost
- Being able to create recurrent jobs using WorkManager
- Listen for notifications so the agent can react to new notifications


## Backlog? 


- Currently we don't send chunks of data to the chat UI, we show the full response
- All conversations from chat UI are stored and displayed and given to the agent in the context
- The telegram conversations are stored and displayed and given to the agent for the context
- Give the model the capability to search on internet using Brave Search
- Improve chat UI so it looks similar to Claude/Chat GPT
